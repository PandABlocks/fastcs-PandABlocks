This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from fastcs_pandablocks import __version__

print(f"Hello fastcs_pandablocks {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m fastcs_pandablocks --version
```
